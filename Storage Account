An Azure Storage Account is a place in the cloud where you can store your data – like files, images, videos, backups, and more.

upported Services: What can you store?
Blobs – files like photos, videos, documents.
Files – shared files, like a network drive.
Queues – messages for apps to talk to each other.
Tables – simple data storage (like Excel sheets).
Disks – virtual hard drives for virtual machines.
--------------------
Storage Account Kinds:
- Standard general purpose v1(legacy)
- Standard general purpose v2
- Blob Storage(legacy)
- BlockBlobStorage
- FileStorage
You can find it in "Account Kind"
Performance tiers: How fast can you perform Read & Write operations.
- Completely depends on "Standard or Premium"
Access tiers: How often do you access the files - Hot, Cool, Archive
Replication: How many redundant copies should be made & where - LRS, ZRS, GRS....etc
Deployment model: Who should deploy the supported services? 
Two models:
- Resource Manager
- Classic
--------------------
Azure Blob storage: Object store for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.
Storage supports three types of blobs:
1. Block blobs:
- Stores text & binary data.
- made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually.
- Store up to about 4.7TiB of data.
2. Append blobs:
- Optimized for append operations.
- Ideal for scenarios such as logging data from VM.
3. Page blobs:
- Stores random access files up to 8TiB in size.
- Store Virtual Hard drive(VHD) files & serve as disks for Azure VM.
--------------------
Multiple ways to move data into Azure Blob Storage:
azcopy: Easy way to use, CLI tool for linux & Windows.
Azure Storage Data Movement library: .Net library(uses azcopy underneath).
Azure Datafactory: An ETL service by Azure.
Azure import/export service: A service where you ship your physical disks for datatransfer onto Azure.
--------------------
Performance tiers(Blob storage)
Two types:
Standard: 
- Stored on HDD's.
- Varied performance based on access tiers(Hot, Cool, Archive).
Use case:
- Bachups & disaster recovery, Media content, Bulk data processing.
Premium: 
- Stored on SSD's.
- Optimised for low-latency.
- Higher throughput.
Use case:
- Interactive workloads, Analysis, AI or ML, Data transformation.
An Premium SSD has no moving parts & data is distributed randomly. That is why it can read/write so fast.

IOPS: Input.Output Operations per second(For read/write).
