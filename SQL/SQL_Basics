SQL: Structure Query Language
- Organized collection of data that is stored & accessed electrically.
- It is essential for handling large amount of data information in structured & efficient manner.
- Using this we can perform "CRUD" operations.

DBMS: Database Management System
- Software that allows users to define, create, maintain & control access to database.
- It acts as intermediary between user & Database.
NOTE: "MySQL" is DBMS software by Oracle.

Types of Database:
- Centralized, NoSQL, Relational, Cloud, Distributed etc.....

Relational Database: Data is stored in Tables format.
Non-Relational Database: MongoDB

To deal with Relational Database we use "SQL" programming language.

SQL Database:
- Data is stored in tables format.
- It can have any number of tables & tables have actual data in it.
NOTE: SQL is case insensitive.

SQL Commands:
- DDL(Data Definition Language): CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, RENAME
- DQL(DATA QUERY LANGUAGE): SELECT
- DML(Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK, 
Advaced DBMS concepts:
- DCL(Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE(for user permissions)
- TCL(Transaction Control Language): BEGINTRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT(used while transaction)

DELETE vs TRUNCATE
using DELETE you can use WHERE and remove particular row data and it can be undo
but TRUNCATE you can completely delete data and cant undo


SQL Datatypes:
Datatype              Description                                                  Example
- INT                 Stadard integer type, 4-byte size(for small names)            age INT
- BIGINT              8-byte size(for large names)                                  total_sales BIGINT
- FLOAT               4-bytes(decimal values 4.11 etc)                              price FLOAT
- DOUBLE              8-bytes decimal values x.11111....                            rating DOUBLE
- DECIMAL             An exact numeric value with precision 'p' & scale 's'         salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
- CHAR(n)             For fixed length characters                                   gender CHAR(1)
- VARCHAR(n)          For variable length characters                                email VARCHAR(100)
- TEXT                Unlimited length characters                                   description TEXT
- DATE                To store date values in "yyyy-mm-dd" format                   birth_date DATE
- TIME                To store time in "hh:mm:ss" format                            start_time TIME
- DATETIME            yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss                                           created_at DATETIME
- TIMESTAMP           store date and time values typically used for track changes   updated_at DATETIME
- BOOLEAN             stores boolean values, may store true as '0' & false as '1'   is_active BOOLEAN
- BLOB                For images or files                                           profile_picture BLOB


NOTE: CHAR(n) takes 'n' values as fixed & occupies place even if data in it is small, so try using VARCHAR(n).
