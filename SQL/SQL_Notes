SQL: Structure Query Language
- Organized collection of data that is stored & accessed electrically.
- It is essential for handling large amount of data information in structured & efficient manner.
- Using this we can perform "CRUD" operations.

DBMS: Database Management System
- Software that allows users to define, create, maintain & control access to database.
- It acts as intermediary between user & Database.
NOTE: "MySQL" is DBMS software by Oracle.

Types of Database:
- Centralized, NoSQL, Relational, Cloud, Distributed etc.....

Relational Database: Data is stored in Tables format.
Non-Relational Database: MongoDB

To deal with Relational Database we use "SQL" programming language.

SQL Database:
- Data is stored in tables format.
- It can have any number of tables & tables have actual data in it.

SQL Commands:
- DDL(Data Definition Language): CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, RENAME
- DQL(DATA QUERY LANGUAGE): SELECT
- DML(Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK, 
Advaced DBMS concepts:
- DCL(Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE(for user permissions)
- TCL(Transaction Control Language): BEGINTRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT(used while transaction)

DELETE vs TRUNCATE
using DELETE you can use WHERE and remove particular row data and it can be undo
but TRUNCATE you can completely delete data and cant undo
