Azure AD: Cloud based "Identity and Access Management" for users to access "External Resources" & "Internal Resources".

External Resources:
- Microsofy Office 365
- Azure Portal
- SaaS Applications

Internal Resources:
- Applications within your Internal Network.
- Access to Workstations On-Premises.

- You can also use it for SSO(Single Sign-On).
- Azure AD comes in four editions:
  * Free tier - MFA, SSO, Basic Security & Usage Reports, User Management.
  * Office 365 Applications.
  * Premium 1 - Hybrid Architecture, AD Group access, Conditional Access.
  * Premium 2 - Identity Protection, Governance

USE CASE: To Authorize & Authenticate to multiple sources. 
- Office 365/Azure Microsift
- To your On-Premise Active Directory
- Web-Applications(using App Registrations)
- Alow users to login with their IPD's(Identity Providers)
  Ex: Google, Facebook

  ACTIVE DIRECTORY                                     (vs)                   AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY:
- Old version(On-Premise version)                                           - New version(Cloud version)
- Both exist now: Based on use case, we use them.
---------------------------------
ADDS(Active Directory Domain Service)
- Servers that users use to authenticate to Directory Service.
- In some cases you need to setup your own Domain Controllers.
- Useful when doing lift and shift from on prem to Microsoft Azure & Migrating Active Directory.
NOTE: In some cases Azure AD doesn't support some domain services.

ADDS provides managed domain services like:
- Domain Joins
- Group Policies
- LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Kerberos/NTLM authentication
NOTE: You can use these domain services without need of deploying, managing, patch Domain Controllers in cloud.
---------------------------------
Active Directory "Tenant":
- Tenant represents an Organization in Azure Active Directory.
- It is a dedicated Azure AD Service Instance.
- Tenant is automatically Created when you Signup for either
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Microsoft Intune
  * Microsoft 365

Active Directory Uses:
- Can assign Roles.
- Add Users to Groups.
- Can enforce Authentication methods such as MFA.
- Track Devices, User Logins from & Allow/Deny Devices.
- Assign Microsoft license.

Azure Active Directory has two types of Users:
- Users: Belongs to your Organization.
- Guest users: Belongs to another Organization.

Active Directory Groups: Lets resource Owners , assign a set of access permissions to all members of group.
- Group Contains:
  * Owners: Has permissions to Add/Remove members.
  * Members: Have permissions to do things.
- Assignments: 
  * You can assign Roles directly to Group.
  * Can assign Applications directly to Group.

Request to Join Group: Check this
  * 


Active Directory assign Access rights:
- Four ways to assign resource access rights to users:
  * Direct Assignment: Resource Owner directly assigns the Users to Resource.
  * Group Assignment: Owner assigns Group to Resource.
  * Rule-based assignment: Owner creates a Group and uses a Rule to define which Users can be assigned.
  * External authority Assignment: Acccess comes from an external source like On-Premise Directory (or) SaaS Application.

Managed Identities: Associates Identities with Internal Resources where these identities have their own Roles & Tokens.
- Increases security by allowing you to link resources directly to other resources
- Two Types:
  * System-assigned Identities: Created & Managed by EntraID, when you create a managed identity in a service instance.
    - Only that azure Resource can use this identity to request Tokens from EntraID.
  * User-assigned Identities(Custom managed identity): Created and managed manually
    - Identity is managed separately from the resource that use it.

System assigned Identity                 (vs)                  User assigned Identity
FEATURE              SYSTEM-ASSIGNED                                      USER-ASSIGNED 
Creation             Created as part of Azure resource                    Created as a standalone Azure resource
Lifecycle            Shared lifecycle with Azure resource                 Independent lifecycle
Deletion             When resource deleted                                Explicitly deleted
Shared across        Cannot be shared(Associated with single resource)    Can be shared(Associated with more than one Azure resource)
Azure Resources

External Identities: Allows people outside your Organization to access your Applications & Resources, while letting them Signin using what they prefer.
- Opposite people can "bring their own identities". Ex: Google, Facebook
- Shares Applications with external users(B2B collaboration)
- Develop Applications inetnded for other Azure Active Directory(Single-Tenant or Multi-Tenant)
- Develop White-labeled Applications for consumers & Customers(Azure AD B2C)

EntraID Access Reviews(Important)
- Allows you to regularly review & manage access to resources in your Organization.
- You can review who has access to resource & determine whether their access is still necessary.
- Helps maintain security, ensures Authorized individuals have access ti sensitive resources.
- Access review can be conducted for various resources like applications, groups, sharedpoint online sites.
- You can configure access review to occur on a regular schedule & select revierers to conduct the reviews.
- Reviewers can be internal or external to your organization.
Cycle: Request sent to Users & Resource Owners--Review Current Memberships--Confirm which membership to keep--Remove Stale membership--Report status to admin--again first step.

During access review the reviewer will be presented with a list of people who have access to the resource.Then he can choose to Approve/Revoke access for each indivudial.
Access can be revoked immediately or scheduled for later date.
This Helps ensure resources are accessed only by necessary users & that access is revoked when no longer needed.

SSO(Single Sign On): It is a feature that allows users to authenticate once with Azure Active Directory and then access multiple applications & Services without having to authenticate again.
- When user signin into EntraID with their credentials, EntarID creates security token that can be used to access other resources within the same organization.
  * This token can be used to authenticate user to other Cloud-based or On-Premises Application that have been integrated with EntraID.
- SSO supports Cloud based applications such as 365, Salesforce, Dropbox, also On-Premises Applications like SharePoint & SAP.
- SSO can be used with custom-built in applications using industry-standard protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect & OAuth.

Several ways you can configure an application for SSO:
- Choosing SSO method depends on how the application is configured for authentication.
  * Cloud applications can use OpenID connect, OAuth, SAML, password-based or linked for SSO. SSO can also be Disabled.
  * On-Premises applications can use password based, integrated windows authentication, header-based or linked for SSO
  * On prem choices work when applications are configured for application proxy.


main SSO Protocol supported in Azure Include:
- Open ID connect & OAuth: 
  * OpenID connect is an identity layer built on top od OAuth 2.0
  * It allows for authentication & authorization of users in a secure and standardized manner.

SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language): It is an XML-based protocol for enhancing a&a data between an identity provider and a service provider.
- Used for federated authentication scenarios.

Password-based authentication: Traditional username/password way.
Linked authentication: Azure provides the ability to link multiple accounts from different providers to single user identity. This allows users to authenticate with any of their linked account.
Integrated Windows Authentication(IWA): Lets users access applications with their windows domain credentials(Using their current windows session for authentication).
Header-based authentication: In this method, the application accepts an authentication token in the form of a header in each request. The token is validated by the application to authenticate the user.
Multi-Factor authentication: A security control where after you fill in your credentials, you have to use a second device like phone to confirm that its you logging.
Conditional Access: Provides an extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets.
- Implemented via Conditional Access policies, which are set of rules that specify the conditions under which sign-ins are evaluated and allowed.
- Conditional access policy analyzes
  * Signals: Users & location, Device, applications & Real-time risk and verify every access attempt via access controls.
    - Signals are metadata associatyed with an identity attempting to gain access.
Users or Group membership: Policies target specific users & groups(Including admin roles), giving admins fine0grained control over access.
Named location information/IP location information: IP address ranges are used to permit or deny access based on geographical locations.
Device: Policies can be applied based on platform or status of user device.
Application: Users attempting to access specific applications can trigger different conditional access polocies.
Real time sign-in risk detection: Signals in Azure AD Identity protection detect risky sign-ins. If risk emerge, policies can prompt actions such as password reset, MFA, or block access pending admin intervention.

Cloud Applications or actions:
User risk: For customers with identity protection, user risk can be evaluated as part of a conditional acces policy.
- User risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compramised.

Common decisions: define the access controls "that deciode what level of access" based on signal information.
Block access: Most restrictive decision.
Grant access: least restrictive decision.
- requires MFA, device to be marked as compliant, hybrid azure AD joined device, approve client application, application protection policy.

We can also use conditional access policy with 365 business premium, E2, E5 Azure AD premium P1 & P2 licenses.


==============================================
ROLES:
Azure has three types of roles that can serve same purpose.
1. Classic Subscription administrative role(Original role system(Retired but do have knowledge on it. Useful when working with Older Azure steups)): Refer to Older model of Azure access control & include three types.
- Account Administrator: Billing owner of subscription. Has no access to portal.
- Service Administrator: Same access of a user who is assigned "Owner" role at Subscription scope. full access to portal.
- Co-Administrator: Same access of a user who is assigned "Owner" roleat Subscription scope. Can be many users.
Works at Subscription level, Resource Group level, Resources level(Azure Account).
-----------------------
2. Azure roles(RBAC): Built on top of Azure Resource Manager(ARM)
- It is a system that provides fine grained access management for Azure resources allowing administrators to grant users specific rights to resources.
  Two types of roles:
  * Built-in roles: Predefined roles offered by Microsoft in Azure read-only & cannot be altered.
  * Custom roles: User defined roles with your requirement.
- Helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what actions they can perform on resources & at what scope.
- RBAC includes 70 built-in-roles.
- Works at root management group/management group mid level(account admin)
- There are four fundamental Azure roles:
  * Owner
  * Contributor
  * Reader
  * User Access Administrator

AZURE ROLES                        READ              GRANT               CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
- Owner                              Yes               Yes                 Yes
- Contributor                        Yes               No                  Yes
- Reader                             Yes               No                  No
- User access administrator          Yes               Yes                 No
-----------------------
3. Azure Active Directory: Works at Tenant level - Top
Used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory, Such as creating/Editing Users, asssigning administrative roles to other, re-setting user passwords, managing user licenses & managing domains among other tasks.
   - Global Administrator: Full access to everything
   - Application admin
   - Application developer
   - Billing admin
- A few Important built-in Azure AD roles you should know.
  * Global Administrator: Full access to everything
  * User Administrator: Full access to Create/Manage users
  * Billing administrator: Make purchase, manage subscriptions & support tickets.
NOTE:
- You can create custom roles but need to purchase either "Azure AD Premium P1 or P2".
- By default Global Administrator don't have permissions to manage Azure resources(Can gain access to Azure resources when given "User Access Administrator" role).
- 1 & 2 can serve same purpose but 2 has more granular support.
-----------------------
OPTIONS WE FIND IN RESOURCES:
Access Controls(IAM): Allows you to create & assign roles to users.
- Role assignments: To assign roles to a service principal(User, Group, Service principal, Managed Identity)
  * It is a way you can control access to resources.
  * role assignment consists of three elements:
    - Scope(Management--Subscription--Resource Group--Resource): Set of resources that access for th erole assignment applies to.
    - Role Definition: Set of permissions that determines what actions can be performed such as read, write or delete on various resources.
    - Service Principal: Represents the identity requesting access to Azure resources such as
      * User: Individuals who has a profile in Azure AD.
      * Group: Set of Users created in Azure AD.
      * Service Principal: A security Identity used by Applications or services to access specific Azure Resources.
      * Managed Identity: An identity in Azure AD that is automatically managed by Azure.
- Deny Assignment: Block users from performing specific actions even if a role assignment grants them acess. Only way to apply deny assignment is through Azure Blueprints.
==============================================
Azure Roles (vs) Azure Policy
Azure Roles (RBAC) = Controls WHO can do WHAT (permissions for users).
Azure Policies ensure that all resources follow a given set of rules. If something goes against the rules, it can:
- Alert (audit mode)
- Block (deny mode)
- Auto-fix (remediation)
==============================================
POLICY: 
- Set of rules that enforce standards & best practices in Azure, to keep resources secure, compliant & cost-effective by blocking, auditing or fixing issues.
- They do not restrict access.
- azure has built in policies that you can use right away.

Policy Definitions: It is a JSON file used to describe business rules to control access to resources.
Policy Assignment: The scope of a policy can effect to. Assigned to User, a Resource Group or Management Group.
Policy Initiative: Collection of policy definitions.
-----------------------
COMPLIANCE: means following rules, standards, or laws set by an organization, industry, or government.

Viewing non-compliant respources: Home > policy > Compliance
- Once a Policy is assigned, it will evaluate for the Compliance state periodically.
- We can see how compliant we are on compliance tab.
-----------------------
Azure Policy Use cases:
- Organizational compliance
- Cost control: Can prevent over-provisioning to save costs. Ex: limiting the creation of high-cost VM's
- Security enhancement: Ex: Require secure transfer for all storage accounts.
- Resource Consistency: Enforce concictent configuration, liken specific naming convention or tags etc.
- Regulatory compliance
-----------------------
Azure Policy Scope: It is the set of resources that the Policy is applied to. When you assign a policy, you can define the scope at which the policy is enforced.
- hierarchy of scope moves from Broad to Specific(Management Group--Subscription--Resource Group--Resources)
- At each level you can apply different policies.
- Policies applied at higher level is inherited by lower levels.
