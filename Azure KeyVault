Helps you saveguard cryptographic keys & other secrets used by cloud applications and services.
KeyVault focuses on three things:
1. Certificate management: For public and private SSL certificates.
2. Key management: Create and control encrypted keys used to encrypt your data.
3. Secrets management: Control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys and other secrets.
NOTE: Certificates contain key pairs.
-------------------
HSM(Hardware Security Management): Piece f hardware used to store encrypted keys.
- It follows following standards recognized by US & Canadian Govt for securing your keys etc:
  * FIPS- Federal Information Processing Standard
  * HSM's that are multi-tenant are FIPS 140-2 level2 Compliant(multiple customers virtually isolated on an HSM).
  * HSM's that are single-tenant are FIPS 140-2 level3 Compliant(single customer on a dedicated HSM).
-------------------
Azure KeyVault-Vault:
Azure KeyVault provides two types of containers:
1. Vaults: Supports software & HSM backend keys.
2. HSM pools: Only support HSM backend keys.
    - to activate it, provide a min of 3 RSA key-pairs(max of 10)
    - Specify min no keys req to decrypt security domain(called quorum).
NOTE: 
- You do not choose container on creation, instead choose Standard or Premium.
- When you choose Premium & create enough RSA key pairs, you will begin to use HSM pools.
-------------------
Azure KeyVault Rest API: Acts as middle man between Application and KeyVault.
Used to programmatically manage Azure KeyVault resources, allowing you to perform operations such as 
- Create/Import/Revoke/Delete Keys or Secrets.
- Authorize users or applications to access its keys or secrets.
- Monitor & manage Key usage.

Azure KeyVault rest API supprts three types of authentication:
1. Managed Identities(most recomended).
2. Service Principal & Cretificate: Uses a certificate for authentication.
3. Service Principal & Secret: Uses Identity & Secret key.
-------------------
Soft delete: Allows you to recover or prmanently delete Secrets fr the duration of retention period(it is enabled by default).
-------------------
Azure KeyVault Pricing:
AKV has two pricing tiers:
1. Standard(Only software protected)
2. Premium(Both software and HSM protected).
-------------------
Azure KeyVault Double encryption
- It is where two or more independent layers of encryption are enabled to protect against compromises of any one layer of encryption.
- Microsoft has two layered approach each for 'Data AT-Rest', 'Data In-Transit'.

Data encryption using customer-managed keys.
Infrastructure encryption using Platform-managed keys.

Transit encryption using TLS 1.2
Additional layer of encryption provided at infra level
