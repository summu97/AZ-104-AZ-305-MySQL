Use ful when Integration with On-Premises:
- It is a tool provided by Microsoft that enables organizations to synchronize On-Premises active directory with Azure AD.
- It enables Organizations to extend their On-Premises identities & security policies to cloud & enables easire access to cloud-based applications.
- It allows SSO from On-Premises workstations to microsoft Azure.
-------------------
Azure Active Directory Features:
- Password Hash Synchronization: This feature Syncs users passwird hashes fron On-premises AD to Azure AD, enabling the same sign-in method for both.
- Pass through Authentication: This allows users to maintain the same password across on-premises & cloud platforms without needing a separate federated environmant setup.
- Federation Integration: An optional feature, it facilitates a hybrid setup using On-Premises AD FS infrastructure & provides management tools like certificate renewal & server deployment.
- Synchronization: This is responsible for creating & alining users, groups & other objects between On-Premise & cloud ensuring identiti information matches across both.
- Health monitoring: Azure AD connect health offers robust activity monitoring with a dedicated azure portal setting to review this data.
-------------------
Steps for installation, configuring, and synchronizing On-Premises AD with Azure AD using Azure AD Connect.
1. Install Azure AD Connect: Install Azure AD Connect on a server connected to both On-Prem AD & Azure AD.
2. Configure Azure AD Connect: Use the Wizard to setup synchronization settings, source/target directories & sync frequency.
3. Synchronize directories: Azure AD Connect syncs On-Premise AD with Azure AD, replicating changes from source to target.
4. Monitor & Manage: Continuously monitor & manage the synchropnization process to ensure accuracy & meet business needs.

Azure AD Application Proxy(Entyra Application Proxy):
- It is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows organizations to provide remote access to their On-Premises web applications.
- It allows users to access the applications securely from anywhere, using any device without exposing application to internet
- Organizations can publish their On-Premise applications to Cloud, providing secure remote access for users.
- It allows organizations use thier existing On-Premise infrastructure & application architecture while leveraging benifits of cloud.
- It provides advanced security features like MFa, Conditional Access policies, ensi=uring only authorized users can access applications.

Azure Application Proxy service consists of two main components:
1. Azure AD Application Proxt connector: A light weight agent that is installed on a server within organizations On-Premise environment.
2. Azure AD Application Proxy Service: A Cloud Based service manages the authentication & authorization of users who access the On-Premise web applications through the application proxy connectors.
   - It also routes traffic to application backend servers & enforces policies set by the organization.

Use case of Application Proxy:
- Remote Access: It is commonly used to provide secure remote access to On-Premise applications. Employees working from home/remote locations can securely access internal applications.
- SSO: It can integrate with AD for SSO.
- Conditional Access
- Legacy application modernization: It can help organizations expose legacy On-Premise applications to interact securely "This can be a key part of strategy to modernize legacy applications".
- Scalability & Performance: It scales automatically to meet your organizations usage patterns & provide a Global reach without needing to open additional firewall ports.
